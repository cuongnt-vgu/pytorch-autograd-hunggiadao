    "### Q3: Suppose each feature $x_j$ needs a separate function $f_j(x_j)$, where $f_j(x_j) = w_j x_j + b_j$. In other words, each feature requires a function, which has a separate set of 1 weight and 1 bias. Therefore, the output $y$ of your function $G(x)=[f_1(x_1), f_2(x_2), ..., f_n(x_n)]$ should be $y = [(w_1 x_1 + b_1), (w_2 x_2 + b_2), ..., (w_n x_n + b_n)]$ (**note:** these are matrices written lazily with markdown). Implement the function $G(x)$, return the output and the gradient sets for each function for a given `x`. The weights should be randomized using `torch.randn()`, and the bias is the same as $j$ of $f_j()$ (for example: $b_1 = 1.0$, $b_2 = 2.0$).
